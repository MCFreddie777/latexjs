    \section{Introduction}
        Basic formatting in \LaTeX.

        \subsection{Text Formatting}
            All the things you want to do, and sometimes should ... emphasis on SOMETIMES.

            \textbf{Bold Formatting} is only between the curly braces.

            \emph{Italics Formatting}

            \underline{Underline Formatting}

        \subsection{Paragraph Formatting}

            New paragraphs are automatically indented.

            \noindent But sometimes you don't want them to be.

    \section{Oddities}

        Strange things worth mentioning.

        \subsection{Misquoting}

        This is how I would normally type 'single' and "double" quotes. Doesn't it look odd?
        Use the \emph{backtick} to make it better.

        - `Single' quotes

        - ``Double" quotes

    \section{Conclusion}

        These are just few of the basic element markers in the \LaTeX file.
